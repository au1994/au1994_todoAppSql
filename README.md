Sorry I am late because I was initially using mongodb as datastore and I was unable to figure out how to use drf 
TokenAuthentication with mongoengine.So built a wrapper inheriting classes of drf to support mongoengine which is still in process.
I switched back to basics that is using relational db with django as drf mongoengine was hampering my project timeline.
Here is the implementation using drf with sqlite.
